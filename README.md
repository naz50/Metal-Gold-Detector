# Metal-Gold-Detector
A metal detector is a type of security tool used in a variety of locations, including shopping centers, movie theaters, airports, and so on, to find potentially dangerous metals. We are currently utilizing Arduino to develop the Metal Detector after previously creating a very basic one without a microprocessor. The coil and capacitor we'll be using in this project are what will be used to identify metals. Here, we've built a metal detector project using an Arduino Nano. For everyone who enjoys electronics, this is a pretty intriguing project. This detector quickly begins to beep if it senses the presence of metal nearby.
# Required Components: 
To construct a basic DIY metal detector with Arduino, you will need the following parts:
1-Arduino (any)
2-Coil
3-100nF capacitor
4- Active Buzzer
5- 220-ohm resistor
6-LED
7-1N4007 diode
8-Breadboard or PCB
9- Connecting jumper wire
10- 9:12v Battery
