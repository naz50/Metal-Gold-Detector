# Metal-Gold-Detector
**A wonderful activity** that gets you outside, explores new areas, and can even provide an exciting discovery is **metal** or **gold detecting**. Verify your local laws regarding what to do in the event of a discovery, especially with regard to **potentially dangerous stuff, archaeological remains, or valuable items with emotional or economic value**.
<br /> A **metal detector** is also a type of **security tool** used in a variety of locations, including shopping centers, movie theaters, airports, and so on, to find potentially dangerous metals. I am currently utilizing Arduino to develop the metal detector after previously creating a very basic one without a microcontroller. <br /> The coil and capacitor I'll be using in this project are what will be used to identify metals. Here, I've built a metal detector project using an Arduino Uno. For everyone who enjoys electronics, this is a pretty intriguing project. <br />This detector quickly begins to beep if it senses the presence of metal nearby.
# Required Components: 
To construct a basic DIY metal detector with Arduino, you will need the following parts:<br />
**1-Arduino (Uno or Nano)<br />
2-Coil 10-20m <br />
3-100nF capacitor<br />
4- Active Buzzer<br />
5- 220-ohm resistor<br />
6-LED<br />
7-1N4007 diode<br />
8-Breadboard or PCB<br />
9- Connecting jumper wire<br />
10- 9:12v Battery <br />**
